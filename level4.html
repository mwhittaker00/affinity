        <h1>Level Four Games</h1>
        
        <p>Level Four is a very small, very independent video game development team.</p>
        
        <p>We want to make video games, but that isn't enough. Games should be fun. Games should be a break from the world. Games shouldn't be so complex that you need to suffer through the tutorial every time you start a new game, but there should still be enough depth to give players the freedom to be creative. We want to make the games we want to play, and that our kids want to play with us. </p>
        
        <h2>Join our community.</h2>
        
        <p>A game is nothing wihtout people to play with. Even single player games provide plenty of opportunities to share our stories. We want people who play our games to come together to find things we may have tucked away, or maybe even come up with solutions we never even imagined.</p>
        <p><a href='#'>Join our Discord</a> to connect with other fans. It's a great place to ask for help or try to pick at a game's lore. It's also one of the first places we'll check when we're looking for bugs to fix!</p>
        
        <h2>Join our team.</h2>
        
        <p>Surprise! The very small, very independent video game development team needs help! We're going to lean on the community to help us through a lot of things like QA and other parts of testing, but a lot of work is needed to make our games come to life. If you think you can contribute to the team, <a href='#'>hit us up on Discord.</a></p>
        
        <p>We need a little bit of everything, but right now we're particularly hurting for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scenery Artists</li>
          <li>Character Artists</li>
          <li>Sound Effects</li>
          <li>Music</li>
          <li>Storytellers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Contact the Team.</h2>
        <p>Did we mention we're <a href="#">on Discord yet?</a> Just in case, I thought you should know we are, and that's a great place to get in touch with us. We're not really doing anything on social media yet but once we've got more to do we'll have links to that.</p>
